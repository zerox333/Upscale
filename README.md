Upscale
=======

Change your device's resolution!

This is the current version of Upscale, originally by [Bryce Dougherty](https://github.com/bd452), and updated by me using [iOSOpenDev](http://www.iosopendev.com). It changes your device's resolution, and allows for the saving of resolutions for future use.

Bryce open-sourced this because he thought it was kind of interesting how he created all of the specifiers at runtime rather than in a plist and then had to make a dynamic number of methods, linked to button cells, at runtime with different values for each method. I ended up using the name of the method as the way to get those values. It's licensed under the MIT lincense, so do whatever you want with it!

Thanks to Bryce and Enjoy!
